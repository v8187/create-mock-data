This tool can be used to generate mock data for your application(s) in multiple cross platform formats. Following are the key features of this tool:


## Features:

- Mock data can be generated in JSON, HTML, CSV and XML formats.
- There is no limit on number of records to be generated. 
- As complex data can be generated as required. 
- Data can be generated with nested Objects/Entities and Arrays/Lists.
- All the Data Types have enough Configurations to customized the output.
- Data Model once created can be saved fot later use. 
- Generating data with saved Data Model/Configurations is just a matter of couple of clicks.
- Generated data can be selected just by single click anywhere on the data screen.
- All the Data Types have default configurations, so it's not mandatory to configure each data type.
- I tried my best to make the tool configurable   to cover the most of the data types and possible value variations for all data types. Let me know, if need to add more Data types and can make it more configurable.
- Data is being created using [@v8187/rs-mock](https://github.com/v8187/rs-mock) node module (written by me only ;)).
- You can use [@v8187/rs-mock](https://github.com/v8187/rs-mock) node module, if you would like to generate data dynamically within your code.
